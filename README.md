# TextExpander
A lightweight console-based peice of software developed by @klazorix.

## What is TextExpander?
TextExpander allows you to type certain triggers and then expand them to larger sections of text.
We use a simple and easy to understand JSON data storage system, alongside a simple python executable.

## Windows Defender notification on installation
Please do not be alarmed if you encounter Windows Defender warnings or warnings from other applications.
These alerts are simply because I am a new developer and it is a .exe file.
