## Security Warnings on Installation
TextExpander is packaged using **PyInstaller OneDirectory** (which is the source of a majority of the files inside the `_internal` folder).
Due to this, as well as the fact that the main application is a .exe file, most Antivirus softwares, including Windows Defender, will block you from downloading and/or running the file.
These warnings are nothing to worry about, as the only reason for the alert is because the code is unsigned (not approved by microsoft).
