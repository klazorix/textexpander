# TextExpander (Source Code)
This branch of TextExpander contains the Source Code for the latest version of TE.

# Warning
This edition is likely to run into issues and errors as the code has been designed to work as a .exe file rather than raw files, however, I believe it is still able to run and work.

# Reminder
A reminder that you must maintain the same open source license if you plan to use this code, as well as provide credit to it's creator (klazorix).
