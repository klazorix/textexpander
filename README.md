# TextExpander (Source Code)
This edition of TextExpander is the raw code (rather than the PyInstaller .exe package). You can use it to verify the security of TextExpander or contribute new features to it.

As per the selected license, TextExpander must remain open source with credit provided to the creator (klazorix) and the project's contributors.  

# Warning: This edition may not work
Due to the fact that these scripts have been designed to run as a .exe directory, these scripts will not run as intended or expected.
For the best results, move all files except `text_expander.py` into another folder called `_internal` to match the file structure of the .exe edition.

# Source Code Version
The TextExpander Source Code is currently matched to `v2.0.0` on the `stable` branch.
